## Introduction

This is a sample application that demonstrates how to use the [Web Storage API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API) to build a bookshelf app. The app allows you to add books to a bookshelf, and then view the books on the bookshelf. The app uses the [IndexedDB API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API) to store the books in the browser's local storage.
